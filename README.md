# Macroeconomic Prediction Model
Code, documentation, and outputs for VMware Summer 2019 Data Science Intern project: producing recession probability forecasts to inform sales quota modifications.

This code was written 100% by my own hand (Daniel Cohen) during my internship.

## Project description
This product leverages federal macroeconomic data from a variety of sources (via the Federal Reserve's FRED API) to produce running one- to six-month recession probability forecasts that are incorporated into a one-pager PDF, which is distributed to sales executive on a monthly basis to inform sales quotas.

N.B.: this project was not originally designed to be hosted on Github, so the code will likely not run as-is. I have uploaded the project here so that potential employers can observe my ability to produce an end-to-end data product.
